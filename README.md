# Binary-Sorted-Tree
A function gives a number and a sorted binary tree and inserts the number into the tree.

A second function, called list-to-tree, takes a list of numbers and a sorted tree, and inserts all of the numbers from the list into the tree. This function can also be given an empty list as an input for the sorted tree.
